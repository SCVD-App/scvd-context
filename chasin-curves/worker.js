// Chasin' Curves — Worker v3.5
// Session 12: Email + 6-digit code auth replaces open username login.
//             member/garage routes now require a valid session bound to the
//             requester's own email — closes the "type anyone's username,
//             become them" gap from v2.1.
// Session 13: Community roads — public member lookup + follow/unfollow.
//             GET /members/:id/public exposes only a minimal public slice
//             (never email/bio/garage) so road attribution can link to a
//             profile without leaking private data. Any authed member can
//             view any other member's public slice — this is deliberate,
//             it's what makes "who added this road" clickable.
//             Follows stored as a single array blob (same pattern as
//             roads/trips), one row per {followerId, followedId} pair.
// Session 14: Logbook (Murphy Report & Logbook compliance feature, phase 1
//             of the master build plan — general-use day-cap logging only,
//             club events land later once a pilot partner club exists).
//             GET/POST /logbook/:id — Use Entry records, same session-owner
//             -only pattern as /garage. `timestamp` is always server-set to
//             Date.now() and a client-supplied value is ignored outright —
//             this is what makes VIC Reg 157(6)'s forward-dating ban (and
//             backdating generally) structurally impossible rather than a
//             UI convention. PUT /logbook/:id/:entryId is the one exception
//             to "entries are immutable": it lets a later return-odometer
//             reading be attached, nothing else about a filed entry can be
//             changed after the fact.
// Session 15: GPS Snail Trail — PUT /logbook/:id/:entryId also accepts an
//             optional `trail` array (opt-in per trip, written once when
//             the trip is stopped, not streamed live). No new endpoint,
//             same immutability rule, just one more optional field.
// Session 17: Server-side points ledger. The whole app went login-gated
//             well before this session, which made the old "roads/trips/
//             reviews/alerts are public, no auth" comment stale — every
//             caller already has a session token, so auth here costs zero
//             extra friction. Added getAuthedEmail() + real awardPoints()
//             calls to /roads, /trips, /reviews, /alerts, /garage/:id,
//             /garage/:id/photo, and /logbook/:id/:entryId (on first
//             odometerEnd completion only — guards against a double-award
//             if that endpoint is ever called twice for one entry). Fixed
//             PUT /member/:id to strip a client-supplied `points` field —
//             Session 12 already stopped you setting someone ELSE'S points,
//             this stops you setting your OWN. rate_road and daily_login
//             are NOT wired: no rating-submission feature or login-tracking
//             endpoint exists yet to hook into.
// Session 18: Stripe Pro membership. Pro is granted directly on the member
//             record (proLifetime / proExpiresAt / proTier) rather than a
//             redeemable token — the app already has authenticated
//             identity, so there's no "lost token" failure mode to design
//             around. Added /create-checkout, /webhook, /checkout-status
//             (self-heal if the webhook hasn't landed by the time the user
//             is redirected back — the exact gap found in Cult
//             Connections' original checkout), and /admin/grant-pro. Pro
//             gates added to /logbook/:id and /logbook/:id/:entryId
//             (Logbook — this covers Trip Postcards too, since those are
//             generated from logged trips; TGM has no live endpoint yet so
//             there's nothing to gate there), and a new-vehicle cap on
//             PUT /garage/:id (free = 1 vehicle; vehicles already over the
//             cap are never removed, just no new ones while free).
//             POST /roads was briefly Pro-gated too, then corrected mid-
//             session: Scott confirmed Add Roads is meant to stay free —
//             it's the whole point of add_road paying 100 points, which is
//             meant to be a path to free Pro months (that redemption
//             mechanic isn't built yet — see handoff.md). Also closed a
//             real self-grant gap
//             found while wiring this up: pitPassActivated now counts as
//             Pro-equivalent (the free 7-day trial), but PUT /member/:id
//             let a client set that field directly with zero server
//             check — same class of bug as the points exploit fixed last
//             session, it just wasn't a monetization risk until this
//             session made pitPassActivated worth something. Fixed the
//             same way: moved to a dedicated
//             POST /member/:id/activate-pit-pass endpoint that re-checks
//             all 6 PIT_PASS_REQUIREMENTS server-side before setting it,
//             and added it plus the new pro fields to
//             MEMBER_PROTECTED_FIELDS so PUT /member/:id can no longer
//             set any of them directly. Also added
//             POST /member/:id/redeem-points once Scott confirmed the
//             original intent behind the points system: 1000 proPoints
//             (a new balance, separate from the tier-badge `points` field
//             — see awardPoints()) redeems 1 free month of Pro. Not
//             publicised in the UI yet — just a plain line in the Points
//             tab — until real accrual rates validate the number.
// Session 19: Planned Runs backend — foundation for a shareable "invite"
//             feature (Facebook/Instagram growth play). Discovered mid-
//             session that /trips + TripPlanner already WAS this feature
//             ("Plan a Run" / "Join this Run" in the UI) — extended rather
//             than duplicated. Two real gaps found and fixed while adding
//             this: (1) app.js's joinTrip() only updated local React state,
//             never called the server — RSVPs were never actually
//             persisted, lost on every reload; (2) the existing PUT
//             /trips/:id pattern is a full-object merge, which is a race
//             condition for concurrent RSVPs if a client ever sent a
//             locally-recomputed attendees array through it. Added a
//             dedicated POST /trips/:id/rsvp that does an atomic
//             read-modify-write of a single attendee's status server-side
//             instead. New: `status` field on trips (open/unconfirmed/
//             cancelled/closed, defaults to open), POST /trips/:id/cancel
//             (host-only, requires a `reason` from CANCEL_REASONS), and
//             GET /trips/:id/public (no-auth sanitized single-trip view —
//             foundation for the public share-link page, not built yet).
//             Nudge/auto-cancel cron, the share page itself, and RSVP/
//             cancel UI are next session — this session is backend only.
//             LIVE BUG FOUND on first real test with a second account
//             (Lorna): every trip-ID route match (PUT /trips/:id, the new
//             rsvp/cancel/public endpoints) compared `t.id === id` where
//             `t.id` is a number (client creates trips with `id: Date.now()`
//             in app.js) but `id` from the URL regex capture is always a
//             string — silent 404 on every one of these routes. This bug
//             pre-dates this session; it was never caught before because
//             the old joinTrip() never actually called the server. Fixed
//             by coercing to `String(t.id) === id` at all four trip-ID
//             comparison sites.
// Session 20: Public run invite page — GET /run/:id, server-rendered HTML
//             (not the React app) with Open Graph tags, since Facebook/
//             Instagram's link-preview crawlers generally don't execute
//             JS. Scott's call on the hero image: rather than build new
//             cover-photo upload infrastructure, reuse the organiser's
//             already-selected vehicle (trip.vehicleId, chosen at planning
//             time) and pull its existing Garage heroPhotoUrl — no new
//             upload feature needed, and it doubles as a "spot the car at
//             the meeting point" cue for anyone who's never met the host.
//             GET /trips/:id/public (added last session) also now returns
//             vehiclePhotoUrl/vehicleLabel for the same reason. All user-
//             authored text in the HTML page goes through escapeHtml() —
//             this route has no auth wall, so it's genuinely public attack
//             surface for stored XSS if a future field skips that step.
//             Cover-photo upload, the canvas-generated Instagram-postable
//             image, RSVP/cancel UI, the nudge/auto-cancel cron, and
//             reliability tracking are still not built — next session.
// Session 21: Waypoint capture (app.js TripPlanner — geocoded stops, first
//             = meeting point, last = end point) plus a run-page redesign
//             per Scott's call: no separate map block, no pins/route line.
//             Instead the vehicle hero gets a thin (opacity 0.22, screen
//             blend) faded map layered on top, with bold waypoint NAME
//             labels positioned by real Web Mercator projection — ported
//             from app.js's own trip-postcard bbox-aspect-correction code
//             rather than reinvented, since that code exists specifically
//             because of a prior alignment bug (route drifting off the
//             roads under it when the requested image's aspect ratio
//             didn't match the bbox). Requesting the map at the exact same
//             16:10 aspect as the .hero CSS box is what makes the
//             percentage-based label positions land correctly regardless
//             of the visitor's screen width.
